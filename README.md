#oops-all-cpp

Welcome to oops-all-cpp! This repository serves as a focused collection of C++ programs, each meticulously crafted to illuminate a specific concept within Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). It's designed to be a clear and accessible resource, providing practical examples to deepen your understanding of OOP principles.
What's Inside?

This repository is structured to guide you through various OOP topics, with each file demonstrating a key concept:
Classes and Objects Fundamentals

These examples lay the groundwork, introducing the core ideas of defining classes, instantiating objects, and managing their members.

    class_addition.cpp: A straightforward class demonstrating basic arithmetic operations.

    date using class.cpp: Illustrates how to model and manipulate date information using a class.

    def class.cpp: A fundamental example of class definition.

    method of class.cpp: Showcases the implementation of member functions (methods) within a class.

    outside method of class.cpp: Demonstrates defining class methods externally to the class declaration.

    real imag.cpp: An example likely focusing on the representation of complex numbers via a class.

    student public private.cpp: Explores the use of public and private access specifiers within a student class context.

    understanding method in classes.cpp: Further elaborates on the functionality and usage of class methods.

    volume of cuboid.cpp: Calculates the volume of a cuboid using an object-oriented approach.

Constructors and Destructors

Understand the lifecycle of objects, from their creation to their destruction, and how to manage associated resources.

    default const.cpp: An example illustrating the behavior of a default constructor.

    destructor.cpp: Explains the role and execution of destructors.

    destructor with loop.cpp: A destructor example, potentially demonstrating resource cleanup within a loop structure.

    parameterized constructor.cpp: Shows how to initialize objects with specific values using parameterized constructors.

    parameterized.cpp: A general example involving the use of parameters, applicable to constructors or functions.

Inheritance

Discover how classes can inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes, a cornerstone of code reusability and hierarchical design.

    hierarchical inheritance_pets.cpp: Demonstrates hierarchical inheritance using a pet-themed example.

    hybrid inheritance_animal classification.cpp: A more intricate example combining various inheritance types for animal classification.

    multi-level inheritance_employee management.cpp: Illustrates multi-level inheritance within an employee management system.

    multiple inheritance_phone features.cpp: An example showcasing multiple inheritance for integrating phone features.

    single inheritance_library management .cpp: A clear example of single inheritance applied to library management.

Pointers and Dynamic Memory

Delve into memory management in C++ and the versatile applications of pointers.

    dynamic 2d matrix with pointers.cpp: Demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a 2D matrix using dynamic memory allocation and pointers.

    dynamic memory allocation.cpp: Basic examples of allocating memory dynamically at runtime.

    func pointers.cpp: Explains the concept and usage of pointers to functions.

    pointer declaration and dereference.cpp: Covers the fundamentals of declaring pointers and accessing the values they point to.

    pointer in array.cpp: Illustrates how pointers interact with arrays.

    pointer increment.cpp: Explores pointer arithmetic and its effects.

    pointer2pointer.cpp: An example demonstrating pointers that point to other pointers.

    smart pointer.cpp: An introduction to smart pointers, offering enhanced memory safety.

    squaring by var point to func.cpp: Uses a pointer to a function to perform a squaring operation.

Operator Overloading

Learn to customize the behavior of operators for your own defined data types, enhancing code readability and expressiveness.

    operator_overloading.cpp: A practical demonstration of overloading an operator.

Constant Members

Understand how to define and utilize constant members within your classes, ensuring data integrity.

    declaring const. out of class.cpp: Shows how to declare constant members with definitions outside the class.

    simple const.cpp: A basic example illustrating the application of the const keyword.

How to Use These Examples

Getting started with these examples is straightforward:

    Clone the repository: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/oops-all-cpp.git

    Navigate to the directory: Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

    cd oops-all-cpp

    Compile and Run: Each .cpp file is designed to be self-contained. You can compile them individually using a standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++). For instance, to compile and run class_addition.cpp:

    g++ class_addition.cpp -o class_addition
    ./class_addition

    This command will compile the source file into an executable named class_addition, which you can then run.

We Hope This Helps!

We trust that this collection of examples will be a valuable asset on your journey to mastering C++ OOP. Happy coding and exploring!
